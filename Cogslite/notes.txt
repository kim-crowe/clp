So we've talked about how we're going to build this thing
We've got a highly motivated team, we've got a plan
We're all set to start delivering value, but we know to realise that value we have to get our software in front of our users

So from the start of this project the focus hasn't just been about building software, it's been about delivering value through our software, and that means
planning it, building it, testing it, documenting it and getting it out there in front of users. 

Now for us in our little bubble that seems kind of easy, we didn't really have any users other than our product owner and no-one else has really been involved, but we know that's not the way its going to be in the future. 

So we took a moment to think about our customers

Sure we've got Nurse, Doctor, Receptionist - blah blah, but you know what

We've also got Support Staff, Database Engineer, Hosted Ops Engineer 

We even went further outside the box

Sales && Marketting

So we created personas for those people, personas that we have and will be creating stories for, because they'll all need to use this system too.

[Sample user stories on slides]

As a support engineer I want to search the event log by user name so I can find the relevant information when diagnosing a support ticket

As a database engineer I want to view performance stats of database calls made by the api so I can identify perforamce issues before they become a serious problem

As a marketing manager I want to get usage stats from the system so that I can make targeted campaigns with real figures

With these personas and stories it means we can tackle concerns such as logging, monitoring, alerts as first class citizens. 
Often that kind of code is thrown in as an after thought, with no real consideration as to how or when it will be used,
